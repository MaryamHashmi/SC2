###Resturant Reservation System
<br>

The resturant reservation system is an online reservation system for their customers. The administration wants to use the same system to ensure optimal resource (servers, tables, time) allocation for any impromptu guests. The restaurant plans to stay open between 11:00am â€“ 10:00pm, serving both lunch and dinner. With experienced staff members, the maximum time required to prepare a single item from the full menu (25 items with 4 appetizers, 2 soups, 12 main course dishes, 3 side dishes, and 4 deserts) is 30 mins. The staff members include 4 chef, 6 servers, and 1 manager, besides other support staff. The restaurant has the following tables available:<br>
1 extra-large table with max capacity of 12 people.<br>
3 large tables with max capacity of 6 people.<br>
8 medium tables with max capacity of 4 people.<br>
4 small tables with max capacity of 2 people.<br>
The restaurant wants to prioritize large parties and will allow the parties booking the extra-large table to set their own preferred time-limit for booking the table, without going over restaurant opening timings. For all other tables, the restaurant allocates time; ensuring maximum bookings, while giving enough time for each party to enjoy their food.
